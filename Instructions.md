# SusRadar Chrome Extension - Complete Implementation Guide

## Overview
SusRadar is a Chrome extension that helps users identify suspicious websites and provides alternative recommendations. It automatically detects tracked sites and shows dropdown alerts with company information, sus ratings, and better alternatives.

## 🎯 Core Concept
- **Company-centric tracking**: Multiple URLs can map to the same company data
- **Automatic detection**: Dropdown appears automatically when visiting tracked sites
- **Manual popup**: Access via extension icon for managing entries
- **Local storage first**: Built for future server migration
- **Playful design**: Goofy, colorful interface with gradients and animations

## 📋 Implemented Features

### ✅ Automatic Site Detection
- Content script monitors all page loads
- Checks current URL against stored mappings
- Shows dropdown alert in top-right corner for tracked sites
- Clean URL matching (removes www, handles domains properly)

### ✅ Manual Popup Interface
- Click extension icon to open popup
- Shows same dropdown interface as automatic detection
- Add new sites to tracking
- Manage existing entries

BUG: For pages that does not exist this menue is different, which it should be. But it looks broken. 
there is no clickable + sign and there are a bunch off random letters displayed at the top. 
BUG: the automatic pop up has nice bebled edges, while the manual has 90 degree edges. 
BUG: ⚙️ no visible either when the url was not found. 

### ✅ Unified Dropdown Component
Both automatic and manual interfaces use the same `SusRadarDropdown` class:
- **Company name** displayed prominently
- **Origin tracking** shows if entry is SusRadar original, user-created, or modified
- **Sus rating bar** (1-5 scale, green to red gradient)
- **Rating dial** animation that bounces on the scale
- **Description** (truncated to 120 chars in dropdown)
- **Alternative companies** (up to 3 shown, with "more" hint)
- **Manage button** (⚙️) to open full management interface

### ✅ Entry Origin System
Three types of entries with clear visual indicators:
- **🚨 SusRadar Original**: Default extension entries (Meta, X, TikTok)
- **✏️ Modified SusRadar**: Original entries that user has edited
- **👤 User Created**: Completely new entries added by user

### ✅ Full Management Interface (all-entries.html)
- **Grid layout** showing all tracked companies
- **Search functionality** across names, descriptions, and URLs TODO: Weird formatting, i would suspect the text marker to be to the right of the amplifying glass
- **Edit modal** with field-level origin tracking
- **Individual field reset** buttons for modified entries
- **Reset all** functionality for modified SusRadar entries
- **Delete entries** with confirmation
- **Focus highlighting** when opened via manage button BUG: This has worked before but does not seem to work now. 

### ✅ Advanced Edit Modal
Professional in-page modal with:
- **Proper form fields**: Company name, rating slider, description, alternatives
- **Field-level tracking**: Each field shows its origin (SusRadar/User/Modified)
- **Granular reset**: Individual 🔄 buttons to reset specific fields
- **Modal scrolling**: Header/footer fixed, form content scrolls
- **Large text areas**: Proper sizing for description and alternatives
- **Working slider**: Full-width rating bar with real-time display
- **Success notifications**: Beautiful temporary feedback messages

BUG: When a field is changed for an existing entry, all the filds show the ✏️ and 🔄 symbol
TODO: Cancle has a weird color. 
TODO: After pressing "Reset all to defaul" I would expect the ✏️ and 🔄 symbols to dissapear. I only want to show these if the field is different from the default.
TODO: scroll does not work as I want. The textboxes has their own scroll. I want the textboxes to increase in size instead, and for the window itself to be scrollable when long text is entered. 


### ✅ Data Architecture
Clean separation ready for future server migration:

```javascript
// Storage Provider Interface
class SiteInfoProvider {
  async getSiteInfo(url)
  async addSiteInfo(url, companyId, info)
  async updateSiteInfo(companyId, info)
  async deleteSiteInfo(companyId)
  async getAllSites()
}

// URL Matching Interface  
class URLMatcher {
  findMatch(currentUrl, urlMappings)
}

// Company Data Model
class CompanyData {
  company_name: string
  sus_rating: number (1-5)
  description: string
  alternative_links: array[string]
  date_added: string
  user_added: boolean
  origin: 'susradar' | 'user'
  is_modified: boolean
  original_data: object | null
}
```

### ✅ Storage Structure
```javascript
{
  url_mappings: {
    "facebook.com": "meta_corp",
    "www.facebook.com": "meta_corp",
    "instagram.com": "meta_corp",
    // ... more URLs mapping to company IDs
  },
  company_data: {
    "meta_corp": {
      company_name: "Meta (Facebook)",
      sus_rating: 4,
      description: "🕵️ Known for aggressive data collection...",
      alternative_links: ["https://signal.org", "https://mastodon.social"],
      origin: "susradar",
      is_modified: false,
      original_data: null
    }
  }
}
```

### ✅ Pre-loaded Data
Ships with information for major suspicious companies:
- **Meta (Facebook)**: Rating 4/5 - Data collection and privacy concerns
- **X (formerly Twitter)**: Rating 4/5 - Content moderation and bot issues  
- **ByteDance (TikTok)**: Rating 5/5 - Chinese data collection concerns

Each includes multiple URL mappings and alternative recommendations.

### ✅ User Experience Features
- **Responsive design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Smooth animations**: Fade-in dropdown, bouncing rating dial
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks for extension reloads
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: ESC to close modals
- **Click outside**: Close dropdowns and modals
- **Focus management**: Auto-focus on form fields
- **Button styling**: Enhanced visibility with shadows and hover effects

### ✅ Technical Implementation
- **Manifest V3**: Modern Chrome extension format
- **Content Security Policy**: Proper external script handling
- **Event-driven**: Proper event listeners (no inline onclick)
- **Error boundaries**: Chrome storage API error handling
- **Clean CSS**: Gradient backgrounds, proper flexbox layouts
- **Modular code**: Easy to extend and modify

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Future-Ready Design
- **Provider pattern**: Easy to swap LocalStorageProvider for ServerProvider
- **URL matcher abstraction**: Can upgrade from exact matching to domain/pattern matching
- **Component-based**: Unified dropdown component used everywhere
- **Data model**: Rich company data structure with extensible fields
